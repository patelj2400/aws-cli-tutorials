# Prerequisites

## 1. What is DevOps?
**Answer:** DevOps is a culture or practice that improves an organization's ability to deliver applications quickly and efficiently. It focuses on automation, quality, monitoring, and continuous testing to streamline the software delivery process.

## 2. Why is DevOps important?
**Answer:** DevOps is important because it eliminates silos between development and operations teams, reduces manual efforts, and speeds up the delivery of applications. It ensures faster time-to-market, better quality, and improved collaboration.

## 3. What are the key pillars of DevOps?
**Answer:** The key pillars of DevOps are:

- **Automation:** Reducing manual tasks to speed up processes.
- **Quality:** Ensuring the application meets the required standards.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously tracking the application's performance and health.
- **Testing:** Ensuring the application is thoroughly tested before delivery.

## 4. What is SDLC, and why is it important?
**Answer:** SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a standardized process used by organizations to design, develop, and test software products. It ensures the delivery of high-quality software that meets customer expectations. It is important because it provides a structured approach to software development, reducing errors and improving efficiency.

## 5. What are the key phases of SDLC?
**Answer:** The key phases of SDLC are:

1. Planning and Requirements Gathering
2. Design (HLD and LLD)
3. Building/Development
4. Testing
5. Deployment

## 6. What is the role of a DevOps engineer in SDLC?
**Answer:** A DevOps engineer focuses on automating the building, testing, and deployment phases of SDLC. They ensure that these processes are efficient, fast, and free from manual intervention, ultimately improving the organization's ability to deliver high-quality software quickly.

## 7. Why is automation important in DevOps?
**Answer:** Automation is important in DevOps because it reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and speeds up the software delivery process. It ensures consistency and efficiency in building, testing, and deploying software.

## 8. What is Agile methodology, and how does it relate to SDLC?
**Answer:** Agile methodology is an iterative approach to software development where work is divided into small, manageable chunks called sprints. It allows teams to deliver incremental updates quickly and adapt to changing requirements. Agile is often used in conjunction with SDLC to make the process more flexible and responsive.

## 9. How does DevOps improve the efficiency of SDLC?
**Answer:** DevOps improves efficiency by automating repetitive tasks, reducing manual errors, and enabling faster feedback loops. It ensures that the building, testing, and deployment phases are seamless and integrated, leading to quicker and more reliable software delivery.

## 10. What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?
**Answer:** A virtual machine is a logical partition of a physical server that functions as an independent computer system. It has its own CPU, memory, and storage but is created and managed by a hypervisor on a physical server.

## 11. What is a Hypervisor?
**Answer:** A hypervisor is a software layer that enables the creation and management of virtual machines on a physical server. It allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical server by logically isolating their resources.

## 12. Why is Virtualization Important in DevOps?
**Answer:** Virtualization improves resource efficiency by allowing multiple applications or teams to share the resources of a single physical server. This reduces waste, lowers costs, and aligns with the DevOps goal of improving efficiency through automation and optimization.

## 13. What is the Difference Between a Physical Server and a Virtual Machine?
**Answer:**

- A **physical server** is a hardware-based server with fixed resources (CPU, memory, storage).
- A **virtual machine** is a logical partition of a physical server that shares its resources but operates as an independent system.

## 14. How Does Virtualization Improve Resource Utilization?
**Answer:** Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server, ensuring that the server's resources (CPU, memory, storage) are fully utilized. This prevents underutilization and reduces the need for additional physical servers.

## 15. What is an Example of a Hypervisor?
**Answer:** Popular hypervisors include VMware, Xen, and Microsoft Hyper-V. These are used to create and manage virtual machines on physical servers.

## 16. How Do Cloud Providers Like AWS Use Virtualization?
**Answer:** Cloud providers like AWS use virtualization to offer scalable and efficient virtual machines (e.g., EC2 instances) to users. They install hypervisors on physical servers in data centers, allowing users to request and use virtual machines as needed.

## 17. What is Latency in the Context of Cloud Computing?
**Answer:** Latency refers to the delay between a user's request and the response from a server. In cloud computing, choosing a data center closer to the user's location reduces latency and improves performance.

## 18. What is the Role of a Hypervisor in AWS?
**Answer:** In AWS, the hypervisor is responsible for creating and managing virtual machines (EC2 instances) on physical servers in data centers. When a user requests a VM, the hypervisor allocates the required resources and provides access to the VM.

## 19. What is the Difference Between a VM and a Physical Server in Terms of Ownership?
**Answer:** A physical server is owned and managed by the organization or cloud provider. A virtual machine, on the other hand, is a logical partition of a physical server and is accessed remotely by users. Users do not have physical access to the VM but can use it virtually.

## 20. What is the Significance of Logical Isolation in Virtualization?
**Answer:** Logical isolation ensures that each virtual machine operates independently, with its own resources (CPU, memory, storage). This prevents interference between VMs and allows multiple users or teams to share the same physical server securely.

## 21. How Does Virtualization Help in Cost Savings?
**Answer:** Virtualization reduces the need for additional physical servers by allowing multiple VMs to run on a single server. This lowers hardware costs, energy consumption, and maintenance expenses.

## 22. What is an EC2 Instance in AWS?
**Answer:** An EC2 instance is a virtual machine provided by AWS. It allows users to run applications on scalable and flexible computing resources in the cloud.

## 23. What are the benefits of using cloud platforms like AWS and Azure for virtualization?
**Answer:**

- **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Pay-as-you-go pricing models reduce upfront costs.
- **Flexibility:** Choose from a wide range of operating systems and configurations.
- **Automation:** Cloud platforms provide APIs and tools for automating resource provisioning.
- **Global Reach:** Deploy resources in multiple regions worldwide.
